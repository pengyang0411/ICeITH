Description: This package is designed to infer relative cell type abundance and 
       its variability across bulk tumor samples obtained from a multi-region 
       sequencing design. ICeITH is a reference-based deconvolution method and 
       it overcomes the limitations of current methods by modeling a 
       patient-specific mean expression to account for the heterogeneity 
       of gene expressions introduced from multi-region sequencing design. 
       In addition, ICeITH measures the intratumor heterogeneity by quantifying 
       the variability of targeted cellular composition and it potentially 
       reveals the relation with the risk of patients' survival.
